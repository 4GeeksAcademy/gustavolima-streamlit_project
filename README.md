# Streamlit App and Machine Learning

The purpose of this project was to create a web app, where through user input, a predictive model would tell the user the probability of having diabetes or not. I used US Diabetes data for this project.

Streamlit is a very easy and fast way to draw and create useful apps be it for web or mobile, with a lot of customization options to craft a visualy appealing interface. Streamlit doesn't oblige you to have strong HTML / CSS / Frontend skills, which makes it even better. 
Using a Random Forest model I've created previously, I've connected it's features to the interface and then execute it after the user inputs the data they wish to predict. 

I've deployed the app in a OnRender which can be used and test at this url:
